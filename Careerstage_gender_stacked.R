#Career stage vs gender
# Louise:
# Need to turn this into a pie chart or something 
# (I wasn't sure of the colour scheme etc so I didn't want to waste time on making 
#   figures before we have sorted that out). 
# Amanda Schadeberg
# My suggestion to the data team is a stacked bar chart 
# so we can show both career stage (bar) and gender (colours within the bar) 
# at the same time â€“ more info for less ink?


# Maria:
# I would separate postdocs from research assistan&researchers. We talk about them separately in the text quite a lot, so I think it can be a bit confusing if we pool them together.
# 
# What about these categories:
# 
# 1. PhD (including PhD with PP)
# 2. Postdoc
# 3. Research assitant+researcher+other ECR

#We need to play with gender and stage (see 03_basic_manipulations for the criteria)
